<h1>Login-system</h1>
<h3>My idea is to implement login system in C++. This program should require registration, 
login and logout function also after login there should be any kind of actions possibilities for user.</h3>
<h3>To do list:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Learn how to allocate object using dynamic allocation</li>
    <li>Add some algorithms and data structures which are going to use credentials.csv and compare them with temp (login) values</li>
</ul>
