<h1>Login-system</h1>
<h3>My idea is to implement login system in C++. This program should require registration, 
login and logout function also after login there should be any kind of actions possibilities for user.</h3>
<h3>To do list:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Actions after wrong nickname during registration</li>
    <li>Error failure after wrong choice 1||2</li>
    <li>Inheritance of request function</li>
</ul>
