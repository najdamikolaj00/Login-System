<h1>Login-system</h1>
<h3>My idea is to implement login system in C++. This program should require registration, 
login and logout function also after login there should be any kind of actions possibilities for user.</h3>
<h3>To do list:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Add some exceptions during setting password like eight characters at least</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you want to add things to github which you changed in few seconds use the following code: "git add -u"</h3>
